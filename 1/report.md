## Task 2

As functional classes change, with incresing degree we observe:
- Bias trend-
    - For degree *3*, the bias graph takes deep dive, then gradually reduces till degree *9*.
    - After that the bias unevenly increases till degree *14*.
    - Then it keeps increasing from there.
    - **Note that** just the general trend of bias falling till approximately degree *10* and then increasing is common, while the other details are case dependent.
- Variance trend:
    - It keeps increasing monotonically till degree *11*.
    - Then it oscillates in a range of *5000*.
    - Then it again increases monotonicalls.
    - **Note that** just the general trend of variance rising till approximately degree *14*, not varying for another *3-4* degrees and then increasing is common, while the other details are case dependent.
